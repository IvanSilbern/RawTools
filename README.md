# RawTools

Welcome to the RawTools page! RawTools is an open-source and freely available package designed to perform scan data parsing and quantification, and quality control analysis of Thermo Orbitrap raw mass spectrometer files. RawTools is written in C# and uses the Thermo RawFileReader library. RawTools is fully compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. RawTools is the replacement for the previously described [RawQuant](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawQuant) Python package. 

The RawTools manuscript preprint is [available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/15/418400).

### Notable news

* **Edit** - The Shiny application is temporarily down for some updates. [2018-09-26] 

* The RawTools Shiny application has been revamped to use a new interface and to provide functionality for plotting of 'Matrix' and 'chromatogram' outputs. Matrix files are generated using the RawTools parse functionality and can be useful for visualizing data temporally across the acquisition. Chromatogram files are also generated using the parse functionality, with the `--chro` flag. The new application is currently available on GitHub [from here](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/tree/master/documentation/manuscript/RawTools_RShiny_Application). [2018-09-26]

* RawTools now offers support for X! Tandem in as a search engine to facilitate calculation of identification-related metrics. IdentiPy remains available and the user may decide which search engine they wish to use. We are working on updating the help documentation to reflect this addition. [2018-09-24]
