# RawTools

Welcome to the RawTools page! RawTools is an open-source and freely available package designed to perform scan data parsing and quantification, and quality control analysis of Thermo Orbitrap raw mass spectrometer files. RawTools is written in C# and uses the Thermo RawFileReader library. RawTools is fully compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. RawTools is the replacement for the previously described [RawQuant](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawQuant) Python package. 

The RawTools manuscript was just accepted for the Journal of Proteome Research special issue on Software Tools and Resources, [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00721). The RawTools original manuscript preprint is [available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/15/418400).

### Notable news

* A RawTools GUI is in the works and should be released soon! Initially this will simply allow you to set up RawTools parameters and run the program using a graphical interface instead of the command line. In the future we plan to add some basic features to visualy explore raw files, as well as to visualize some of the parse and QC data similar to our R Shiny app. If you have any features you would like to see in this regard, let us know by creating a [feature request](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)! [2019-01-07]

* Thanks to a lot of behind the scenes work, the file downloads of plots from the Shiny app are now working! [2018-12-06]  

* The R Shiny application now has greater support for plot customisation. We have also added the ability to highlight points on QC plots. Lastly, we have added a new 'multi-plot' page where multiple scan matrix files can be input at once and plots for all files will be generated alongside one another in the same space. The latest version is live on the web and available here.  [2018-11-29]

* The Shiny application has been updated to allow downloading of pdf versions of the created plots. These images can be imported to programs like Adobe Illustrator and will be treated as vector images. We have also added the ability to mouseover data points to see values, as well as corrected some bugs. We have also added the ability to add mean and median lines to the QC plots. The latest Shiny web interface is available [here](https://rawtoolsqcdv.bcgsc.ca/). [2018-11-07] 

* RawTools now offers support for X! Tandem in as a search engine to facilitate calculation of identification-related metrics. IdentiPy remains available and the user may decide which search engine they wish to use. We are working on updating the help documentation to reflect this addition. [2018-09-24]

### Modifying RawTools

If you want to modify the RawTools source code, you will need to get a copy of RawFileReader from ThermoFisher. Otherwise the project will not have access to RawFileReader and you won't be able to debug or compile any code you write. You need to request access to Thermo Fisher's file share site to do this. It is a pretty simple process: you just need to email and request access. Details for access and subsequent installation of the package in Visual Studio can be found on the [RawFileReader page on planetorbitrap.com](http://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader#.W6471U9lA0M).

Please make note of and respect the [RawFileReader license](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/blob/master/RawFileReaderLicense) in any modifications you make and wish to distribute.
